# Recursion

Create Fibonacci sequence and merge sort functions based on recursion method.

## Features

- **Fibonacci Sequence**:
  - `fibs(seqNum)`: Generates a Fibonacci sequence iteratively up to the given number of terms.
  - `fibsRec(seqNum)`: Generates a Fibonacci sequence recursively up to the given number of terms.

- **Merge Sort**:
  - `mergeSort(array)`: Implements the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.
  - `merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight)`: Merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
